Hi, Iâ€™m Samuel and I'm currently studying at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow. During my studies, I discovered a passion for computer
networks and related technologies. I'm dedicated to learning how to code in C/C++/Python and applying this knowledge in the field of
computer networks. Here, you can find some of my codes and projects. I hope to provide more advanced codes in the near future :)
